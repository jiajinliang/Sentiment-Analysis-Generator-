TP:
Don't let the expensive location of Coronado Beach deter you from searching out this little pizza joint. Their handcrafted freshly made food should be enjoyed by all who visit beautiful San Diego.

TN:
Nice worker 4 stars. It's a simple liquor shop with quick bites. You can get a thin slice of pizza to go. They have tater tots, wings, sandwich and wraps. This is more if you are looking for something fast and mediocre to go with alcohol. I missed why where they voted "best pizza by locals?" It's not gourmet. I had pepperoni and it was just below ok.
